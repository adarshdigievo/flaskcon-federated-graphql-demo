 This repo holds two demos used in my Flaskcon Talk.
 
1. Simple Graphql demo - found in /[demo1-graphql-basics-monolith](demo1-graphql-basics-monolith)
2. Federated example - found in /[demo2-federation](demo2-federation)

### Setup Instructions

- Python version I used for the demo is 3.12. It should work fine for 3.9+ also.

- The requirements are common across both demos. Activate a venv and install requirements from requirements.txt initially. Setup instructions for the demos are specified in their own subdirectories.
